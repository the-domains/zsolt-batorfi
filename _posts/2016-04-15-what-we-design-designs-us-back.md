I'm confident humans don't get the real meaning of infinity. they think it is something that has no limits, so it is said to be infinite. how far from the truth: something is infinite when it _transmutates_ back into _itself_. so it is infinite because it _has no ends_. even imagination has it is limit. consciousness is the closest thing to infinity.
