description: 'The Higgs field is an energy field that is thought to exist everywhere in the universe. The field is accompanied by a fundamental particle called the Higgs boson, which the field uses to continuously interact with other particles. As particles pass through the field they are "given" mass, much as an object passing through treacle (or molasses) will become slower.'
